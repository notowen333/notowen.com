This is my second try at a software blog. My first attempt was in college. I was studying at Wesleyan University, a small liberal arts college in Connecticut, trying to get a software internship. At Wesleyan the CS curriculum focused mainly on the math/proofs/programming languages. I had very little practical software engineering skills. I didn't know what a unit test was, I hadn't heard of SQL, and I didn't understand the basics of a client server relationship.

I also didn't have interview-style alogrithms skills so I failed all the automated assessments that companies sent me. This began my quest to learn practical skills and get a job. I joined the [privacy tech lab](https://privacytechlab.org).
